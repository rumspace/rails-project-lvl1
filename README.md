user = User.new job: 'hexlet'
 
HexletCode.form_for user do |f|
  f.input :name
  f.input :job
 f.submit
end
```

# <form action="#" method="post">
#   <label for="name">Name</label>
#   <input name="name" type="text">
#   <label for="job">Job</label>
#   <input name="job" type="text" value="hexlet">
#   <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Save">
# </form>

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
